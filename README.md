# Book Store CLI

Book Store CLI is a Golang-based command line application that allows users to **list, add, update, and delete books**.  
The application uses Go’s standard libraries such as `flag`, `encoding/json`, and `os` to provide a simple and efficient CLI experience.

All book data is stored locally in a `books.json` file, making this project lightweight and easy to understand for beginners learning Go backend and CLI development.
